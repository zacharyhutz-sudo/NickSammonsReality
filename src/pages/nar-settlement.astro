			<p class="text-stone-500 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
				In March 2024, the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) announced a settlement that changes how real estate professionals and homebuyers work together. Here is what you need to know about the new standards of practice.

				<!-- Key Change 1 -->
				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-12 gap-8 items-start">

						<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-serif tracking-tight text-navy-900">Mandatory Buyer Agreements</h2>
						<p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
							Transparency is at the heart of the new industry standards. Before these changes, many buyer-agent relationships were informal. Now, all real estate professionals are required to have a signed written agreement in place before showing any homes. This agreement clearly outlines the services provided and the professional relationship between you and your agent.

				<!-- Key Change 2 -->
				<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-12 gap-8 items-start">
					<div class="md:col-span-1 text-gold-400 font-serif text-4xl italic">02</div>
					<div class="md:col-span-11 space-y-4">
						<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-serif tracking-tight text-navy-900">Agent Compensation Clarity</h2>
						<p class="text-stone-600 leading-relaxed font-light">
							Historically, buyer agency compensation was often coordinated through the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). Under the new settlement, offers of compensation are no longer displayed on the MLS. While sellers can still choose to offer a credit or compensation to a buyer's agent, these details are negotiated directly between the parties. This change ensures that you have a clear, upfront conversation about how your representation is compensated.

							<h4 class="text-xs font-black uppercase tracking-widest text-gold-500">Do I have to pay my agent?</h4>
							<p class="text-sm text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">Agent compensation is negotiable. While many sellers still offer compensation to facilitate the sale, your agreement will outline exactly how I am paid for my expertise and representation if the seller does not cover the full amount.</p>
